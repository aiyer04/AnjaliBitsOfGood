	    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
	    <p>Hello! My name is Anjali Iyer and I am a second-year computer engineering major from Cumming, Georgia (Forsyth County). In my free time, I enjoy playing tennis, playing the piano, reading, or working out. Throughout high school, giving back to my community was a huge priority for me and I spent many weekends organizing and participating in musical performances at local retirement communities. I want to continue giving back at Georgia Tech and believe that the best way I could do this is to keep using the skills I gain and knowledge I acquire while in school and apply it in a way that benefits those around me. </p>
